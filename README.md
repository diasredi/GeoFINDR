# GeoFINDR

This repository contains all the source code and experimental results data used for the article *GeoFINDR: Practical Approach to Verify Cloud Instances Geolocation in Multicloud* written in April 2025 by S.IDER and M.LAURENT. For more details about GeoFINDR, refer to the article through this link [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18685](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18685) . We recommend to read the article before working on GeoFINDR.

## How to use

### Use case

GeoFINDR is a method used to verify the physical location of cloud instances given in from the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) in the Service Level Agreement (SLA). To function, the cloud instance must be connected to the Internet and able to run GeoFINDR. 

GeoFINDR runs using python code and libraries are installed using pip.

### Installation

**1\) Install python 3** 

Tested with latest 3.12 and 3.13 versions [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**2\) Download GeoFINDR**

Download the `GeoFINDR.zip` file from the GitHub repository and extract the files in the desired location.

You can also download the repository using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diasredi/GeoFINDR.git
```



**3\) Install dependencies**

Through a terminal in GeoFINDR's directory, install dependencies using pip [https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/):

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Startup

**1\) Modify the setup parameters**

Create a file called `.env`. The `.env` file must include the fields loopback_adress, proxy_adress, declared_latitude, declared_longitude, real_latitude, real_longitude, tolerance, zone_size, sector_lm_nb and interval_percent.

Modify the values in the `.env` file to enter the desired setup parameters. The parameters `proxy_adress`, `real_latitude` and `real_longitude` are optional and can be set to `null`. An example of is given in the `.env.example` file.

**2\) Start GeoFINDR**

Start GeoFINDR through a terminal.

On Windows :

```shell
python main.py
```

On Linux/Unix :

```shell
sudo python3 main.py
```

Note: the `sudo` command is used to grant Python (pythonping library) access to ping's socket data.

## Experimental results

### Protocol used

Experiences where conducted from Telecom SudParis campus at Evry in France. 

The goal is to find if GeoFINDR is able to identify a lie in the SLA delcaration and if it can find the real location of the cloud server. We tested a range of values for parameters tolerance, zone_size, sector_lm_nb (NB_LM) and interval_percent independently. Multiple false positions were declared around the world and the accuracy of GeoDINDR's real position estimation was measured with the value `distance_estimation_declared`.

### Results

The results, the log outputs and the main codes are available in the `experiments` directory. The are available in compressed zip files respectively `experiences_results.zip`, `experiences_outputs.zip` and `experiences_main.zip`

Experimental outputs are available in `experiences_outputs.zip` and were generated by using the command `sudo python3 main.py > output.txt`. CSV files with final results values used in the GeoFINDR article are available in `experiences_results.zip` and were obtained by defining the `real_latitude` and `real_longitude` values in the `.env` file, c.f. Startup.
